Make sure to replace 'New folder/YourGameName.js' and 'New folder/YourGameName.json' with the appropriate paths to your Unity game build files.

Save the modified HTML file and ensure that the "New folder" containing your Unity game build files is in the same directory as the updated HTML file.

Open the HTML file in a web browser, and it should display your Unity game within the unityContainer div, alongside the other buttons and audio elements.
